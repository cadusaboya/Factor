Hello guys,

This is my first project that I want to actually deploy to the world. It consists of an iOS App that allow Doctors to receive their future income if they want if some spread(My profit is the spread)

I'm building this on React Native to easily deploy on Android, also don't own a Mac currently to build in Swift, but I'm buying on to deploy the app eventually. I'm using Django as the back-end, I've done my final project using Flask and, since I know Python, I thought I would also learn Django so I can become more profficient on it.

There's still ton of errors to fix and stuff to do, this is a learning experience and something I wish to publish on my portfolio in case I start applying for jobs, so I thought starting to use git to deploy versions of my software to be a good practice that I'll need. Doing this will also help me recover working parts of my project in case I screw things up and since its already the biggest project I've done, I think hiccups will happen lol.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have interest in contributing or just to talk :)
